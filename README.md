## Special Thanks

Huge thanks to **Claude** ([@claude](https://github.com/claude)) for the foundational contributions to the agent architecture and intelligence correlation engine. This project wouldn't exist without that work.

## Why Now?

We're living through a critical moment. As the US-Iran conflict escalates, information becomes both a weapon and a casualty. Governments on all sides control narratives. Social media is flooded with propaganda. News outlets pick sides. Regular people — the ones actually affected by airstrikes, sanctions, and chaos — are left trying to figure out what's real.

During the 2020 Iran missile strikes, flight tracking enthusiasts on Twitter spotted diversions before news outlets reported anything. During Ukraine, OSINT researchers using public satellite imagery exposed troop movements that governments denied. Open-source intelligence isn't just for analysts anymore — it's how civilians protect themselves and each other.

**Clawdwatch exists because:**
- Mainstream media is slow and often biased
- Governments lie or withhold information
- Social media is full of propaganda and misinfo
- People in conflict zones deserve real-time, verified intel
- The tools exist — they just need to be connected

This is about democratizing situational awareness. If a missile is heading somewhere, if flights are diverting, if ships are going dark — people should know before it hits the news cycle.

## What is Clawdwatch?

**Clawdwatch** is an autonomous OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) agent that monitors, aggregates, and analyzes publicly available data from multiple sources — giving you real-time situational awareness during conflicts and global events.

No propaganda. No bias. Just data.
