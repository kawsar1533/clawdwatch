## Special Thanks

Huge thanks to **Claude** ([@claude](https://github.com/claude)) for the foundational contributions to the agent architecture and intelligence correlation engine. This project wouldn't exist without that work.

## Why Now?

We're living through a critical moment. As the US-Iran conflict escalates, information becomes both a weapon and a casualty. Governments on all sides control narratives. Social media is flooded with propaganda. News outlets pick sides. Regular people — the ones actually affected by airstrikes, sanctions, and chaos — are left trying to figure out what's real.

**Clawdwatch exists because:**
- Mainstream media is slow and often biased
- Governments lie or withhold information
- Social media is full of propaganda and misinfo
- People in conflict zones deserve real-time, verified intel
- The tools exist — they just need to be connected
